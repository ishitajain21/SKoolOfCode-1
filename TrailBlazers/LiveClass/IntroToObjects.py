#Almost eveything in python is a object. 
#Let's a simple example e.g. string

#Dir function to find
myName = "Shiv"
print("Operations supported by object named",myName, dir(myName))

#Note the supported operations are not depedent on the variable name but 
#on the name what type of object is stored in the variables. 
#We had a 'string' stored in myName. Let's store a integer instead
