##Project Details
#YoBot your friendly bot needs a new skill.
#Chinese Zodiac Animal signs have been a craze this year. 
#You as chief engineer have been tasked to add this skill to Yobot! 
#Yobot should ask the customer his/her yearOfBirth and native language 
#( English, Hindi or Bengali). YoBot then greets the user also telling him 
#the animal of year. E.g. “Namaskar”. “Good to see some one from the year of the Dragon. 
#Welcome!”Note : The restaurant is in the college campus and most clients 
#are students who are typically born after year 2000. Use this link to 
#get the zodiac sign information that you would use in your program.

#PseudoCode
#Get the inputs. Validate that they are correct. 
#If inputs are not valid, show relevant error and exit the program
#If inputs are valid, move to next step
#Print thanks for the valid inputs

#Welcome the user and tell him what you are about
print("Hey , I am Yobot! I Welcome in your native language and show your chinese zodiac")

native_lang = input("Input your native lanuage - 1 for Eng 2 for Hindi")
print(native_lang)
